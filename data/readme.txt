There are two folders within, one has the nonnetwork data in both a .csv and a .dta format (.dta is a Stata extension and I do most of my work with Stata).
The other folder has codebooks to help you know what the variables and values mean.
Variable names have prefixes (either C1W1 or C1W2).
These prefixes tell you if the variable is from Cohort 1 or Cohort 2 and Wave 1 or Wave 2. The variables names that are in the codebooks come after.
