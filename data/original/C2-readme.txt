There are two changes to be aware of from C1 to C2.

First, the name of the variable that captured the number of people a person has used drugs with in the past 30 days has changed.
In cohort 2 this variable is listed as NSD1 whereas it was listed as ND1 or was a duplicate name in cohort 1. 

Second, we added 5 new substances for non-injection drug use in C2W2 that are not present in other waves.
I included them for you, as I wasn’t sure if they would be useful or not. They are C2W2_17 – C2W2_21.
